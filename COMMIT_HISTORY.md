'1131c27' - Initialized Node.js project with basic structure.  
'8e7b57a' - Added a complete user authentication module with all necessary layers. Created the user model to define the database schema for storing user information. Implemented a controller with methods for user signup and login, handling request validation and responses. Developed a dedicated service file containing all database-related logic to keep the controller clean and focused on request handling. Added a DTO (Data Transfer Object) file to enforce input validation and ensure the structure of incoming data is correct and secure. Also included a utils file with various helper functions, such as password hashing and token generation, to promote code reuse and modularity. This setup ensures a well-organized, maintainable, and secure foundation for user authentication.
